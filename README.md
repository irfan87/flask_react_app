# Movies App

## Description

It is a simple application that build with Flask and ReactJS. All the data was saved at MongoDB.

## Features

MongoDB is easy to learn and run, especially if you already know how the database - such as MySQL, Postgres and etc, works, and it's architecture. The only different is, MongoDB is a non-relational database compare than SQL.

Flask, is a friendly Python web framework either for beginners or experienced developer.

ReactJS, a library that was developed by Facebook. For this project, I prefer to use hooks than class-based component, even you still can use if you know and have solid OOP knowledge in JS.

## How to run this project in your machine?

If you would like to try, you can run `npm run start-api` to run the back end, and `npm start` to run the front end. Then, you are good to go! :+1: :sunglasses:
